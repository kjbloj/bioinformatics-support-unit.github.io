The BSU has expertise in the following areas, and software packages:

#####High-Throughput Sequence Analysis

* BWA, Bowtie and other aligners for all NGS platforms and applications
* Mira, Velvet and SPAdes for de novo assembly, including HGAP for PacBio data
* Tophat, Cufflinks, DESeq and Trinity (among others) for RNA-Seq analysis, including single-cell expression analysis with Monocle
* GATK, VarScan and MuTect for variant calling
* MACS, SISSRs and other peak callers for ChIP-Seq analysis
* Bismark for bisulphite sequencing
* Kraken and QIIME for metagenomics sequence classification

#####Microarray Analysis

* Experience with data from all major array platforms (Affymetrix, Illumina, Nimblegen & Agilent)
* Varying data types, including expression, methylation (450K), MEDIP-ChIP, and tiling arrays
* GeneSpring GX
* BioConductor/R

#####Proteomics Analysis

* Bioinformatic screening for potential protein-protein interactions
* Analysis of SILAC data using MaxQuant
* 2D-GE analysis

#####Further Expertise

* Remote homology and domain detection using HMMs
* Database design
* Custom pipeline creation
* Custom software engineering

As well as these analysis services, we also provide training courses and bespoke 1-to-1 training for researchers and industry. We provide an introduction to Linux/Next-Generation Sequencing course at least annually (currently this course runs approximately every nine months). We also run a Bioconductor course in conjunction with Colin Gillespie. More courses will be added to our portfolio in the coming year. Full details available on the ["Courses" page]({{ site.baseurl }}/courses) of this site.
